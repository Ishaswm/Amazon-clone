Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across various screen sizes and devices.

Challenges Faced
1. Responsive Design Complexity
One of the primary challenges encountered during the development of this Amazon homepage clone was ensuring a seamless and responsive design across various devices. Balancing the layout to look visually appealing on both large desktop screens and smaller mobile devices required careful consideration of CSS media queries and flexible design patterns.

Solutions Implemented
In response to these challenges, several solutions were implemented:

CSS Flexbox and Grid: Leveraging the power of CSS flexbox and grid layouts significantly simplified the handling of complex alignments and responsive design.

CSS Preprocessors: Using CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less helped organize styles, manage variables, and enhance maintainability.

Browser Testing: A rigorous testing process across multiple browsers and devices, coupled with the use of browser-specific CSS adjustments, ensured a consistent user experience.
